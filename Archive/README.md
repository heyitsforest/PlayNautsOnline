# Archive
This directory contains information regarding archiving Awesomenauts.

The current method involves using [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader) and a .cmd script to download every available manifest. 

# Why?
When Awesomenauts is deleted from Steam, having more available builds may make it easier to decompile or combine versions.

# How can I help?
If you have available storage, run the script and download as many versions as possible.
